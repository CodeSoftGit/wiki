# Superar la ansiedad del Mapping
Mapping es una manera creativa de crear arte, como los otros tipos de arte, pones una pequeña parte de ti en todos los mapas. Como tal, puede ser difícil recibir muchos votos negativos o comentarios negativos, o no conseguir ningún compromiso. Esto es especificamente verdadero para aquellos que son sensibles por naturaleza, o para aquellos que nunca se han puesto alla afuera. Sin embargo, es importante que recuerdes que tus mapas, y lo que la gente piensa de ellos, no tiene nada que ver con tu persona. Tu tampoco estas solo en tus sentimientos de sindrome de impostor, ansiedad alrededor de subir to mapa, o problemas con hacer pasar la critización dura. Aumentando conciencia y empezando conversaciones de estos sentimientos es el primer paso para superarlos.

Esta pagina no sustituye, de ninguna manera, real, ayuda profesional. Si este tipo de sentimientos te plagan, específicamente en tu dia a dia, entonces por favor considera ponerte en contacto con un profesional o alguien cercano. No hay verguenza en necesitar ayuda, no te hace debil o nececitado. Es importante tener este tipo de conversaciones y reconocerlos como sentimientos verdaderos que cualquiera puede experimentar, y que a veces hay problemas mayores debajo de la superficie.

## Votos Positivos y Negativos
Es muy facil mirar a muchos numeros, que naturalmente tienen un valor cuantitativo, y intentar y aplicarlos de una manera para juzgar calidad. Incluso hay un sistema de calificacion directamente conectado a BeatSaver por cada mapa. Puede ser dificil mirar los numeros y no tomarlos en serio, especialmente si tu mapa recive muchos votos negativos o muy pocas descargas. Sin embargo, hay muchos factores que pueden entrar en estos numeros, y es injusto que tu intentes usarlos para validar tus mapas y tu mismo. Si tu te estas sintiendo ansioso con muchos votos negativos o muy pocas descargas considera estos puntos:

* Pudieron haber picado el boton incorrecto.
* Puede que no les haya gustado la cancion.
* Ellos pudieron estar tristes que fallaran.
* Las luces pudieron ser incomodas.
* La cancion puede ser muy unpopular.
* Tu nombre puede que no sea muy conocido.
* Lo publicaste en el momento incorrecto.
* Tu mapa fue enterrado entre los otros mapas muy rapido.

Por supuesto, puede er completamente posible que pudiste haber hecho errores en tu mapa, o el jugador no pudo estar de acuerdo con como construiste tu mapa. Esta bien. Siempre hay algo nuevo que aprender, especialmente si estas en la etapa temprana de el aprendizaje del Mapping. De nuevo, un mapa "malo" no se refleja en ti, nisiquiera como un mapper. Todos aprendemos a diferentes velocidades, y todos tenemos diferentes opiniones en que funciona y que no. If you notice that you’re getting a lot of negative feedback on your maps, take a step back and consider if you need to go back and work on some of the fundamentals. If you do, that’s also okay. Your ‘bad’ maps will not haunt you or hang over you forever; they are not permanent, and no one will think about them as much as you do.

If you have controversial mapping opinions, or are mapping primarily for yourself and choose to ignore certain mapping rules, you are more likely to attract negative feedback (although you may also attract a very loyal fanbase that love your specific style!). It’s completely fine to map for yourself and to create what makes you happy, but it can be a trade-off that you must be willing to accept as a mapper. It’s possible that, with time, the community’s opinions will grow to be more aligned with your own, but you cannot count on it. As such, everytime you choose to break a commonly accepted mapping rule, consider whether or not you’re okay with your map not being well-received.

If you’re struggling to cope, consider some of these options:

* Keep your maps private. If you truly map only for yourself, and you’re unhappy with how people respond to your maps, then there’s no problem with keeping them only for yourself.
* Don’t look at Bsaber or BeatSaver. If you’ve made a habit of it, you might find it difficult to not subconsciously open a new tab and check, but it’s a good habit to break. Obsessing won’t make you happy, and no number will never be large enough for long.
* Review your knowledge and get more testplays. If you don’t understand why your maps are getting so many dislikes, reach out to some more experienced mappers and ask for help.
* Take a break from mapping. Mapping should be a fun hobby, and if it causes you a lot of grief, it might be time to step away and take a break.
* Speak to a professional. It’s only human to feel hurt if someone dislikes your work, but panic attacks or constant intrusive thoughts are a sign of an underlying problem that requires the help of a professional.

## Critical Feedback
Not every map you make can be perfect, and sometimes you might hear your map's flaws laid out directly in front of you. This can hurt, and might make you feel defensive, but it’s always best to take a breather first if you find yourself getting emotional.

Always consider whether the feedback is meant to be constructive, or destructive. Needlessly harsh language, or personal attacks, should never be present in constructive criticism, and can be disregarded. However, people predominantly want to help, especially when giving testplay feedback. After taking a step back, try and take what’s said as having been done so with good intentions, and try and listen objectively. When we spend so long on a map, we can become attached to certain parts of it, and this can feel like an attack on our ideas or abilites, rather than an issue with the map itself. Still, an outside perspective can be invaluable. Try not to let your emotions get in the way, and if you find you’re not able to, consider whether you might need to take a break, and reach out to someone.

Keep in mind that critical feedback on a map is just that; feedback on your map. It has nothing to do with you, personally. Don’t rely on other people to love your map in order for you to feel good about it; you should, first and foremost, be happy with your own work, even if that feels difficult at times.

## Upload Anxiety
It is normal to feel some apprehension when uploading a map, and submitting it for ‘public judgement’. For most people, these feelings go away with time and experience, but it can stick around for others. It’s important to consider why you are so nervous about uploading; are you afraid of not getting many downloads, or getting a lot of dislikes? What does those things really mean, to you? Consider whether your fears are realistic and grounded in reality. For example, being afraid that you might upload a map and everyone will hate it so much that they will never play your maps again is catastrophizing.

The worst case scenario is that your map only receives dislikes and some bad reviews, but if that is the case, there is nothing stopping you from taking the map down. One bad map (or even multiple, in the grand scheme of things) will not haunt you forever. No one will remember it more than you will. Most mappers have maps that they have taken down as some point or another.

## Imposter Syndrome
You might be surprised to know how many of your favorite mappers hate their own maps. Many people - from mappers, to artists, to professionals in other careers - can all feel as if they have no idea what they’re doing, and feel afraid of being ‘found out’. Sometimes, just knowing that you’re not alone in feeling this way can be a great help. We are often our own worst critics, and we have seen the behind-the-scenes of our entire mapping process, not just the polished final product. We know what part of the map we struggled with and are hyper-aware of every little detail, when the vast majority of people would never know. We know what parts of mapping we find challenging, and as we get better, we only become more and more aware of everything we DON’T know. This is all a natural part of learning and growing, but it’s important to understand how far you’ve come, and how much you really do know.

Take a look at some of your older maps, maybe a cringe a bit, and you will realise how much more you know and understand. Maybe you’ve been experimenting recently, and it hasn’t worked out well, but at least you had that knowledge foundation to try new things and expand on everything you’ve learned.

It’s also very easy to focus on the negatives. It’s possible your last map got 8 downvotes, but what about the other 156 upvotes? Those 156 enjoyed your map enough to actually vote on it. Actively looking for the positives is a great way to combat these feelings.

## Helping the Community
If you’ve ever had someone leave a positive review on your map, or DM you to tell you how much they love your map(s), you’ll know just how amazing it feels. Unfortunately, this is a relatively rare occurrence, even for the best mappers. Still, it doesn’t have to be. Be the change you want to see in the world! Making other people happy can have a profound effect on your own happiness, and a great way to do that is to let other mappers know how much you love their maps. It’s a nice way to form connections with other people within the community, and even one review can inspire other people to do the same thing, which is a snowballing effect.

It’s important, both as a community and as individuals, to be open about mental health and negative emotions that are large issues in gaming social circles. Knowing that other mappers aren’t infallible, and that we can all experience the same emotions, can be extremely important in helping others to help themselves.
