# Custom Sabers

## Installation
:::tip HINWEIS Saber müssen speziell für Quest oder PC angefertigt werden und sind nicht zwischen den beiden austauschbar. Du kannst anhand der Dateierweiterung erkennen, für welche Plattform ein Saber bestimmt ist. `.saber` files are for PC while Quest uses `.qsaber` or `.whacker` files. :::

### PC Saber
The latest mod for Custom Sabers is now called Saber Factory, and can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). Run Mod Assistant, select the Saber Factory mod, and click Install.

If it is not available in the above sources, you can visit the [SaberFactory Discord](https://discord.gg/PjD7WcChH3) for more information or check the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/SaberFactory/releases) for the mod. Once you have downloaded the mod, put the mod in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md) to install it.

Once the mod is installed you will see a folder called `CustomSabers` in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use.

You can download more sabers on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/).

For those who want a simple custom saber mod, the Custom Sabers mod is still being updated by Nalulululuna, and can be found [here](https://twitter.com/nalulululuna/status/1493263219485405184).

### Quest Saber
Custom Sabers for Quest are provided by the Qosmetics mod. The latest version can be found in the [#quest-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord. Sabers are called `whackers` and are currently hosted in the [Qosmetics Community Discord](https://discord.gg/qosmetics). Legacy filetypes like `.qsaber` made for older versions can still be used. `.zip` files can also be used but will require you to extract **only** the `.qsaber`.

## Verwendung

### PC User
Inside the game in the main menu you will see on the left a `CUSTOM SABERS` or `SABER FACTORY` button under the `Mods` section. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use.

### Quest User
Upload the `.whacker` file to your Quest using the [BMBF Web Interface](/quest-modding.md#installing-mods). You can then select which saber is active from the Qosmetics menu in-game.
