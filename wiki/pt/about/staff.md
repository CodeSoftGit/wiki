# Staff

_Seja em rela√ß√£o ao gerenciamento de projetos, aprova√ß√£o de plugin/mod, gerenciamento de servi√ßos centrais, coordena√ß√£o de eventos, ou muitos outros projetos secretos, h√° sempre muito trabalho a ser feito. A comunidade n√£o existiria sem as incont√°veis horas contribu√≠das por esses indiv√≠duos incr√≠veis, ent√£o, por favor, d√™ a eles uma rodada virtual de aplausos (e ajude a pagar pelos servi√ßos, se puder)._

## Bloodcloak

A guy that is really into Japanese and EDM music with the occasional K-pop song. Loves creating dance style maps and playing rhythm games. _Totally_ hasn't fallen into the Vtuber hole and makes computer code that works! _"Most"_ of the time...
