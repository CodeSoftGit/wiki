## Genewaw Typs

Beat Saber can be a pretty physically demanding game and it is important to treat play sessions just like a workout. We strongly recommend that you stretch and warm up before each play session to avoid physical injury, including damage to the wrist and shoulders. Common injuries include repetitive strain injury (RSI) to the wrist and shoulders.

Stretching isn't just limited to people playing crazy custom songs either, you can injure yourself even if a map seems short or simple.

## Tino's Guide to Warm Up and Recovery

Generally, we **do not recommend** using weights for this game. Beat Saber is already a workout and people hurt themselves all the time without weights. You're basically subjecting your wrists to constant whiplash, and adding weights is only going to make things worse.

If you insist on using weights then please at least check out [this guide](https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/beat-saber-weighted-gear/) by VR Fitness Insider to minimize the risk of injury.

Keep your playspace clear of obstructions, allow adequate room around during gameplay, and always wear your wrist straps.
